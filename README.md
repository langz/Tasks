This is a small project where I will create a list of tasks, where I can add and remove tasks. It will be connected to Firebase, to try and have a real-time database in the background. SO the project is mainly to tryout AngularJS with Firebase.
It is also connected with Twilio and Zapier, so when you press the send notification, it will send a sms from my Twilio account and to my cell-phone with a notification for the task with some information.
